<pre>from Pawel's e-mail:

           "here are four plots for RMS of individual capIDs (for
             HB, HE, HO and HF seperately).
            we are looking at ADC counts.
            this is single run (from CRAFT, but this is typical
            for all runs)."

these plots are used to set the criteria for acceptable RMS for
 the RM's to pass pedestal RMS test at Fermilab - for HB,
 pedestal RMS for all channels must be less than 0.92
